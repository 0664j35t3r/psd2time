# INTERPOLATION SCHEME #
########################
# the interpolation scheme can be either "linear" or "logarithmic"
# the interpolation schemes are analogous to those available in FEMFAT Spectral

# DIFFERENTIATION/INTEGRATION #
###############################
# The given PSDs describe either a "displacement", "velocity", or an "acceleration"
# Since in frequency space the integration over time or the differentiation in repsect to time
# can be easily accomplished, the input and output quantities can be specified independently
input displacement
output displacement

# PSD DEFINITIONS #
###################
# For every time series a PSD must be specified, 
# in addition cross-PSDs can be specified in order to describe correlations.
# PSDs and cross-PSDs can be written as Hermitian matrix
# Therefore it is sufficient to only specify the upper or lower triangle of the matrix
# Non-specified PSDs are assumed to be equal to zero.
# Every PSD must be defined in a separate file text file.
# The first column defines the frequency points, and the second and third columns
# the real and imaginary parts of the PSDs. The third column only plays a role for cross-PSDs.

# GRAPHICAL OUTPUT #
####################
# To verify the output some plots can be generated
# "plot psd" generates the PSD of a time series or the cross-PSD of two different time series,
# this plots can be used to cross-check with the input data
#
# plot psd of generated time series 1
